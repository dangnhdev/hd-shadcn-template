## Feature Prioritization Framework

Features are prioritized using the RICE framework:

**Reach:** How many users will benefit?
**Impact:** How much will it improve the user experience?
**Confidence:** How confident are we in the estimates?
**Effort:** How much time will it take?

**Score = (Reach Ã— Impact Ã— Confidence) / Effort**

### Current Priority Queue
