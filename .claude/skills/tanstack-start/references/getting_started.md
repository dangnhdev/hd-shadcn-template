## TanStack Start Overview

- Are there limitations?
- How is TanStack Start funded?
- Ready to get started?

TanStack Start is currently in the Release Candidate stage! This means it is considered feature-complete and its API is considered stable. This does not mean it is bug-free or without issues, which is why we invite you to try it out and provide feedback! The road to v1 will likely be a quick one, so don't wait too long to try it out!

TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more. Thanks to Vite, it's ready to develop and deploy to any hosting provider or runtime you want!

TanStack Start is built on two key technologies:

90% of any framework usually comes down to the router, and TanStack Start is no different. TanStack Start relies 100% on TanStack Router for its routing system. In addition to TanStack Router's amazing features, Start enables even more powerful features:

That said, if you know with certainty that you will not need any of the above features, then you may want to consider using TanStack Router alone, which is still a powerful and type-safe SPA routing upgrade over other routers and frameworks.

The only relevant limitation is that TanStack Start does not currently support React Server Components, but we are actively working on integration and expect to support them in the near future.

Otherwise, TanStack Start provides the same capability as other full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Remix, etc, with even more features and a more powerful developer experience.

TanStack is 100% open source, free to use, and always will be. It is built and maintained by an extremely talented and dedicated community of developers and software engineers. TanStack.com (also open source) is owned by TanStack LLC, a privately held company, 100% bootstrapped and self-funded. We are not venture-backed and have never sought investors. To support the development of TanStack Start and other TanStack libraries, TanStack.com partners with these amazing companies who offer both financial support and resources to help us continue to build the best possible developer experience for the web community:
